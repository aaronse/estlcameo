# 📸 EstlCameo

### **“Undo-style snapshots for Estlcam.”**

EstlCameo is a tiny Windows app that automatically saves **versioned snapshots** of your Estlcam project every time you press **Ctrl+S**. It gives you a simple timeline viewer so you can browse older versions and restore any one of them without ever risking your original file.

### ⭐ What It Does

* **Auto-snapshots** your `.E12` file whenever you save in Estlcam
* **Shows a handy toast** with a preview of each snapshot created
* **Timeline Snapshot Viewer** **Ctrl+R** lets you view and scroll back through all snapshots
* **Restore safely** as a copy (never overwrites your original file)
* ~~**Quick Undo/Redo** of snapshots using `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`~~
* **No plugins, no hacks, no changes to Estlcam**

Just run EstlCameo once, and it quietly works in the background.

## 🚀 How to Use It

1. **Download EstlCameo.exe** from Releases
2. Run it — a small tray icon will appear
3. Open Estlcam and work normally
4. Every **Ctrl+S** → new snapshot
5. Press **Ctrl+R** anytime → open Timeline Viewer

That’s it. No setup, no configuration.
